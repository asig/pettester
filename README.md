# PETTESTE2K

This is the collection of PETTESTE2K ROMs that David Roberts shared in [this post](https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/pettester-versions-and-manuals.1238265/post-1252044).

I decided to upload them to a github repo after spending a *lot* of
time searching for the manual on the internets, primarily for my own convenience.
